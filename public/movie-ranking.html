<h3>路 the seventh seal (dir. ingmar bergman)</h3>
<p>super cool movie set during the plague. a knight challenges death itself to a chess match. existentialism and so on. loves it.</p>
<h3>路  amadeus (dir. milos forman)</h3>
<p>cooky ass (fake) story about mozart /pos. salieri is mozart's rival. shenenigans ensue. beautiful costumes, brilliant acting, unforgettable story. taken from peter schaeffer's play.</p>
<h3>路 the master (dir. paul thomas anderson)</h3>
<p>this is trauma and unhinged behavior in a movie. oh it's also about cults. scientology, to be exact. our main characters are deranged.</p>
<h3>路 barry lyndon (dir. stanley kubrick)</h3>
<p>this movie makes me horny (in an aesthetic sense). it's beautiful. the acting is top notch. every frame is a painting. main character is a rogue-y piece of shit (relatable).</p>
